<h1 align="center">Tetris Matura project 🎮</h1>
<p align = "center">🟧🟪🟨🟦🟥🟫🟩</p>

This is my high school matura project for the subject Informatics - a digital product, that is a personal interpretation of the classic game from the eighties: "Tetris", with it made entirely in Unity. 

<h2>What is Unity?</h2>

Unity is a computer game creation software that supports various platforms for 🖥️ desktop , 📱 mobile devices , 🕹️ game consoles  and 🥽 virtual reality. It is a tool that provides developers with a 2D and 3D platform for creating video games. 

What makes Unity so attractive to developers is that it's simple to use, as well as the built-in physics, so developers don't have to worry about every last detail.

<h2>Why this type of project?</h2>

The reason why my project assignment is a finished product of this kind is that I want to finish my higher education in the field of programming, by becoming a computer game programmer or a software engineer. 

I believe that with this project I will gain a greater idea of the principles in the creation of more complex computer games. Since Unity, like the C# programming language, is not part of the high school curriculum, I had to gain previous experience with the software and its important components, as well as the programming language, which, although similar to C++, due to its common origin, still has its differences. 

That's why before starting this project, I made simpler computer games: "Snake" and "Minesweeper", which are lighter in weight, due to fewer programs and elements needed for a complete creation.

<h2>Why Tetris?</h2>

The reason why Tetris is the game that I created as a worthy game for a project assignment is because the game itself weights the various events that take place within it. 

Some of the functions are: grouping the individual elements as a single unit (tetromino), the way the tetromino itself will move and rotate, creating a movement barrier, functions to drop the figure, clearing the filled row, score system, etc.
